Communicating emotions to others is something that all people have to deal with in life in order to maintain their relationships and get support for their issues, but for people struggling with mental illness, this can be simultaneously especially important and especially difficult. Due to the strength and confusing nature of what they feel, it can seem like the world is unsupportive or doesn’t understand, preventing emotions from being expressed. 

In many cases, people fear receiving a bad response from others and don’t share. It’s something that is hard to build up the courage to do, and people can feel unprepared, unskilled, or anxious in a situation where they want or need to express how they feel. It’s a problem that has very few dedicated resources to help a person overcome their anxieties and feel prepared.


</ProjectImageBlock>

Prepare Bear is a robotic animal device that communicates with users through speech, similar to Alexa, helping them work through emotions and practice conversations. It practices conversations with users and gives them practical experience speaking their feelings in a personable and comforting experience. The robot will have interchangeable faces to convey dynamic emotions. It can help a user identify a person to talk to (such as a therapist or friend) and identify conversation goals. The robot can also help them workshop a conversation by incorporating data built throughout conversations, and also providing feedback based on the user’s goals.

## Design Walkthrough

One main task to be accomplished with the help of Prepare Bear is "Evaluating Emotional Needs", finding a path forward
from intense emotions, by talking through an issue with Prepare Bear and determining if you need to speak to someone, 
what you need to communicate to them if so, and general emotional processing. The second is "Preparing What You're Going to Say" 
in a conversation with another person by iteratively workshopping sentences with feedback from Prepare Bear based on goals. 
These are our focus tasks because we identified from our research two major barriers to communication being the inability 
to process what you're feeling and lack of concrete preparation.

The way this system is designed behind the scenes is through multiple dialogue trees that guide the user through
these conversation paths.

## Design Research and Key Insights

We lacked information about the reasons why someone might have trouble expressing their feelings in a conversation
and what people want out of the before and after of a conversation. We knew that knowing the main barriers to 
communication and people's wants would be essential in building our product. To solve this issue, we conducted 3 
research activities: two interviews with people who had experience with therapy and an online survey released to the 
online public receiving 36 responses, but with a large portion of responses coming 
from people with self-identified therapy experience. We targeted this 
demographic because we believed their experience with emotional communication would offer greater relevance and insight. 
To capture this, our questions for all activities were structured around the two research questions of "What barriers exist?" 
and "What makes communicating effective?".
We conducted interviews to gain dynamic insights in the typical way, but put out a survey as well to reach more 
people in order to verify our understanding of this serious topic that we did not have expertise on. 

### Lack of Preparation Tools

        {
            src: research_insight1_1,
            alt: "Initial design sketch of Pot Pal synthesizing previous information and " +
            "displaying it on its screen as well as talking about it.",
            caption: "Initial section of DT1 influenced by the want of an emotional guidance tool"
        },
        {
            src: research_insight1_2,
            alt: "Initial design sketch of Pot Pal synthesizing previous information and " +

            caption: "Loop structure of DT2 motivated by common mental walkthrough preparation"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"250px"}
>

Both interviews identified that the most common way for them to prepare for conversations was for them to run
through the problem and the conversation in their head. Interviewee 1 stated: "I guess I would say, I go over the 
scenario in my head and, I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing sometimes." Interviewee 1 on multiple occasions 
expressed a real desire for some sort of tools that would help a person identify what they are feeling in preparation for
communication. Many survey responses when asked for what they would want if they could have anything to prepare for a conversation,
could not identify a specific thing, often writing "something" to help them feel better. One response
wrote, "A guide that tells me about all the emotions and difficult feelings I'm feeling." These statements indicated to us 
that there was a need for a concrete tool to help prepare for emotional conversations compared to the nebulous existing methods.

This identified want motivated the concept of our project, and certain suggestions were implemented. Both the above statements
influenced our "Identifying Needs" dialogue tree's process of walking through emotions. The interviews talking about running
through conversations in their head motivated our "Prepare for a Conversation" dialogue tree as a practice and feedback session
where the conversation partners' response is considered, streamlining this mentioned process of mental run-throughs
into something more structured and with impartial help.

### Concern about how others react deters individuals from opening up

    images={[
        {
            src: research_insight2,
            alt: "Initial design sketch of Pot Pal synthesizing previous information and " +

        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"350px"}
>

Survey responses included a variety of reasons for why one can be afraid of communicating emotionally such as burdening
the listener or not wanting to come off as vulnerable. Quote from one response: “fear of judgement and not wanting to 
worry them.” Interview 1 also identified it as one of three major barriers to communication in their life: Participant 
in full stated “Yeah. I think it’s those two, and then just the guilt of worrying or stressing people around me.” This shaped our design direction by motivating us to include features that could ease this worry by specially considering who the
user wants to speak to and their possible reaction, and giving feedback based on this context during the "Preparation" phase. 
This in combination with generally easing worries through focusing on how to effectively communicate towards a wanted outcome 
attempts to make the user feel more confident in how they will converse with someone else.

### People express a strong need for comfort/a way to ease anxiety before a difficult emotional conversation. 

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: research_insight3,
            alt: "Initial design sketch of Pot Pal synthesizing previous information and " +
            "displaying it on its screen as well as talking about it.",
            caption: "Sympathetic Response tree, added later but building off existing system of providing validation and comfort"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

For the survey question asking what they would have to prepare if they could have anything, many answers stated: “Something
that makes me less anxious”, “Something to get rid of that heavy, sick feeling of nervousness”, “A hug from a close
friend or my partner”, “My dog”, “Something that makes me stop crying”, “A way to regulate overwhelming feelings”, etc.
Interviewee 1 identified worry about burdening others as a large barrier to communication, but stated that their therapist and parents reassuring them 
allowed them to overcome that fear and realize they wouldn’t be judged, making communication easier in the future.
This shaped our design direction by heavily influencing the concept of our design as something that would appear 
comforting and sympathetic and also offer reassurance often. This manifests at many points in our dialogue tree processes, 
especially our entire "Sympathetic Responses" system, and one of our end-of-path messages directly being inspired by this
Interview 1 insight which stated that people need to reassured that people in their life are willing to listen.

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: prototype,
        alt: "A boxy paper panda bear. Next to it is a diagram of interchangeable " +
        "faces it can take on",
    }}
    direction={"column"}
    caption={
        "The physical paper prototype we used to test our dialogue trees during iteration"
    }
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
</ProjectImageBlock>

As with other groups, we started by creating a paper prototype of our system, which included our paper prototype bear
and also our two main task dialogue trees we developed. Then we had inspection done by other groups, made edits based
on the heuristic evaluation results we identified as most important, then we did usability testing with three
participants by letting them speak to the physical bear and a tester speaking as the bear following the dialogue trees,
then making small revisions to the prototype in between based on breakdowns encountered. Due to the nature of our
project, what we were testing mainly was our dialogue trees and how people interacted with the process, which in 
usability testing really allowed us to identify problems with natural conversation flow, while heuristic evaluation
helped identify features and best practice inclusions we overlooked because of our unique focus.

### Allowing the User to Control Their Process

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: revisiontree,
            alt: "Initial design sketch of Pot Pal synthesizing previous information and " +
            "displaying it on its screen as well as talking about it.",
            caption: "One revision from this insight, the revision tree handling user backtracking at any point"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

It was mainly from Usability Testing that many inspectors
identified that our dialogue trees as streamlined processes did not allow for much user control
on when to exit, redo, or navigate in a conversation, and seemed to be guide-railed on a certain 
path, breaking the "User Control" heuristic. We then added a stop tree to shutdown the bear at
any point in the conversation, and a redoing statement function. We also experienced a breakdown
during a usability test where a user stated they didn't like the feedback given and felt like the 
system was forcing them to follow it. It became clear to us that not only should users at any point be
in full control of their position in the process, but also the system's underlying priorities. To
do this, we redesigned the feedback system to allow users to edit their goals and feedback preferences
if not satisfied with feedback received.

### Making System Status and Processing Visible

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: facialdisplay1,
            alt: "Initial design sketch of Pot Pal synthesizing previous information and " +
            "displaying it on its screen as well as talking about it.",
            caption: "Addition to facial system displaying the level of audio input received to the user in real time"
        },
        {
            src: facialdisplay2,
            alt: "Initial design sketch of Pot Pal synthesizing previous information and " +
            "displaying it on its screen as well as talking about it.",
            caption: "Addition to facial system displaying to user when system is loading/thinking for transparency and waiting"
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={5}
>

What the system is doing and how it is interpreting user's input should be made visible to the
user in real time or promptly after data collection. Also from Usability Testing, we received
many reports identifying a lack of visible state and prompt feedback in violation of the "System
Visibility" heuristic. Due to our system being predominantly a speech interface, we did not have
many initial points where feedback was given to the user as we focused on developing a dialogue
process, but we realized on the technical side and for clarity this was essential. Using our defined
facial system that previously existed just to add a responsive human element, we added facial states 
that representing thinking and receiving input so that the user would be aware in real time that the
system is pausing to process or that their audio is being picked up and listened to. Where this
insight heavily factored into our iteration is our consideration of a change for exclusion, where
we considered how to handle harder-to-parse accents or speech styles, and realized the whole system
would benefit from more checkpoints after data collection segments where the collected information
is reported back to the user and the user is able to edit errors. We added many checkpoints along our
dialogue trees in consideration of this, giving users that feedback soon after collection.

This insight came mostly from usability testing, where across tests many system breaks occurred when
the user asked questions or made statements that were not anticipated by the dialogue tree. 
Participant 2 in particular asked many questions for advice and clarification. Participant 3 gave
the feedback that the current process felt like a systematic interrogation in the way the system
asked series of questions without interruption. This identified to us that the rigid trees created
needed to allow for natural side-roads in conversation, and the user could even benefit from
divergences in the form of questions.

So, we added a question-taking tree to our system, a sympathetic
response system that made the system respond more naturally to user speech in between tree nodes, and
an error tree handling all other diversions with a reminder of system state and ability to redirect
if needed. We believe all of these changes improve user experience with improved natural dialogue, 
offering more user assistance, and handling error cases in defined ways.
