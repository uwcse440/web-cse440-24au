    Discovering unique and memorable experiences should not be a challenge, yet many existing platforms fail to meet the
    mark. Most travel and location-based apps provide generic recommendations, overcrowded tourist spots, or outdated
    information that lacks personal relevance. Users are often left sifting through reviews, blog posts, and forums,
    hoping to stumble upon hidden gems that truly resonate with their interests. This process is time-consuming and
    frustrating, especially for those looking to explore lowkey, off-the-beaten-path destinations that offer authentic
    and unforgettable experiences.

    Gem Hunter is a community-driven app designed to help users explore and uncover hidden gems near them or wherever
    their adventures take them. Unlike other platforms, Gem Hunter combines the power of user contributions, personalized
    discovery, and gamification to create a vibrant ecosystem for exploring the world. With each new hidden gem
    unlocked, participants will accumulate reputation points which they can use to discover even rarer hidden gems.

## Design Walkthrough

In our mobile application Gem Hunter, we focus on enhancing user engagement and interaction through two key
features. First, we refine the location tracking functionality to ensure precise and reliable discovery of 
hidden gems, allowing participants to unlock new attractions added by others. Second, we developed a 
reputation points system that rewards users for their contributions and discoveries, motivating them
to explore further and engage more deeply with the app. These features are vital as they directly support the
primary goal of our app, which is to foster exploration and build a vibrant community around discovering hidden gems.

### Discovering Hidden Gems On The Go
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: radius,
            alt: "Adjust the radius to where you would like to get notified for the hidden gem.",
            caption: "Adjust radius where you would like to get notified for the gems."
        },
        {
            src: preferenceImg,
            alt: "Select your preferences of what hidden gems you would like to find.",
            caption: "Select your preferences of what types of hidden gems you would like to find."
        },
        {
            src: pushNotif,
            alt: "After closing your phone, you will get a push notification if you're nearby a hidden gem in your interest.",
            caption: "After closing the app, you will get a push notification of a nearby gem in your interest."
        },
        { 
            src: popupImg,
            alt: "Once clicked on the notification, the hidden gem will appear as a in app pop-up with minimal information about the hidden gem found.",
            caption: "Once clicked on the notification, the hidden gem will appear an in app pop-up with minimal information on it."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

    Participants are prompted to adjust their radius for nearby gems through an intuitive slider interface,
    ensuring they receive alerts within their preferred range. They can easily set filters for the types of
    gems they wish to discover. As users continue exploring within the radius, they receive a push notification
    about gems that are nearby that meet their criteria from previously. Upon tapping the push notification,
    they are directed to an interactive map where the pop-up of the hidden gem is displayed. They can expand the
    pop-up to view more information on the hidden gem, and from there can decide if they would like to visit the hidden gem.

</ProjectImagesBlock>



### Sharing Personal Experiences of Hidden Gems to Obtain Rewards

Participants are encouraged to share their unique experiences and insights about the hidden
gems they discover. The app's intuitive interface makes it simple for users to pin new locations,
upload photos, write reviews, and provide tips for future explorers. As users contribute
valuable content, they earn reputation points that can be redeemed to unlock access to even rarer
hidden gems, enhancing their exploration journey.

## Design Research and Key Insights

While developing Gem Hunter, we aimed to understand how people discover hidden gems in Washington State.
Our initial approach involved conducting a detailed 14-question survey to gather insights into participants'
discovery methods. Additionally, we interviewed both temporary and permanent residents to gain diverse
perspectives on uncovering these hidden gems. By understanding this process, we can then proceed to create an easier
solution to finding more hidden gems in Washington State.

We restricted our research on temporary residents, such as students, and permanent residents in Washington
State who are likely familiar with the state's hidden gems. There are numerous ways to discover hidden gems,
including social media, community boards, and news outlets. Given the variety of methods available, targeting this
demographic provided valuable insights for designing an app that caters to a world heavily influenced by social media.
**I don't really like that last sentence, if someone could change it please, that would be great :')**

We designed a 14-question survey to uncover how people discover hidden gems, complemented by interviews with a 
Californian native living temporarily in Washington and a native Washington resident. Both the survey and interviews
covered participants' demographic information, discovery habits, favorite hidden gems, and their methods for finding 
these spots. We distributed the survey across multiple platforms, including friends, local community groups, and community
boards for Washingtonians. The diverse range of responses we received enabled us to gather a variety of perspectives
and identify patterns in exploration behaviors. Through our interviews, we aimed to gain deeper insights into how both
non-natives and natives of Washington State discover their own hidden gems.


### Encouraging Users to Share Hidden Gems

Of the people who responded to the survey, a quarter of them mentioned having a strong sense of ownership over the hidden
gems they find, which can lead to exclusivity behavior. Participants expressed a desire to keep unique locations to themselves,
fearing that sharing might lead to overcrowding. One participant noted, "When I find a great lowkey spot, I tend to not want to
share it with anyone except close friends and family." This insight posed a significant challenge as to how do we encourage users 
to share their hidden gems? This insight helped us identify the need to create compelling incentives for users to share their discoveries.

            caption: "Participants claimed they use various methods of platforms to gain information on hidden gems."
        },
        {
            src: clutterImg,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
            caption: "Social media tends to clutter hidden gems making it frustrating to navigate"
        },
    ]}

    width={6}

### Diverse Discovery Methods and Preferences

Our research revealed that discovering new hidden gems can be challenging due to the multitude of 
available methods. Participants utilize social media, community boards, and word of mouth, among other means,
to find hidden gems. This diversity became evident when we asked about their major concerns and preferences 
regarding apps with similar functionalities, like Yelp. While Yelp provides excellent insights on food, it falls
short in helping users find hidden gems **Idrk if this sentence is good.. lol.**. The overwhelming feedback indicated
that users wanted a seamless and efficient way to discover hidden gems without additional effort. Based on this insight,
we recognized the importance of creating something intuitive that accommodates various discovery methods and integrates
seamlessly into users' routines.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Spontaneous Discoveries

One of the key takeaways from our design research was that many participants discovered fun and memorable 
experiences through spontaneous explorations. These moments often left the deepest impressions because they 
felt authentic and unforced, arising naturally from being in the right place at the right time. In one of the 
interviews, the participant highlighted some of their most fun experiences that were not even planned. This highlights 
the importance of designing a platform for spontaneous discoveries, which supports and enhances spontaneous discovery 
without over-planning or dictating the journey. By creating an environment where users can confidently wander, stumble 
upon hidden gems, and create unplanned memories, Gem Hunter fosters a sense of adventure and connection to the 
moment—qualities that are often lost in rigidly structured travel experiences. This emphasis on spontaneity 
ensures the app aligns with the innate curiosity and joy of discovery that makes exploration so rewarding. 

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

Our iterative design process involved several key stages: paper prototyping, heuristic evaluation,
usability testing, and creating digital mockups. We began with paper prototyping to quickly explore
and refine our design ideas based on initial feedback from our design research. Heuristic evaluations
were conducted to ensure our design adhered to usability principles, identifying potential issues
early. Usability testing with a diverse group of participants provided insights into real user Experiences
and challenges, guiding our design improvements. Finally, digital mockups were created to visualize and further
refine the design. This iterative approach was motivated by our goal to adapt the process to the
project's needs, ensuring that each phase built upon the previous one to surface crucial
design insights and create a seamless, user-friendly app.

From these tests, we found that our participants highlighted the importance of Implementation
of a rating system for informed decision-making, enhancing navigation for better user control, and
providing clear feedback response mechanisms. Participants seemed to appreciate the ability to make
informed decisions based on a comprehensive rating system, improved navigation features that empowered them
with greater control and ease of use, and a clear and consistent feedback response mechanism that ensured
they receiived timely feedback. These enhancements, directly informed by participant feedback, played a pivotal
role in evolving our design to meet user needs more effectively.


### Implementation of Rating System for Informed Decision Making

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: beforeRatings,
        alt: "A before and after image of implementing the rating system into our application.",
    }}
    caption={
        "Before, the paper prototype shows no ratings or filter ratings within the add a contribution and expand gem page. " +
        "The digital mockup now shows a rating system and filtering to allow users to filter through ratings within the app."
    }
    width={7}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Introducing a rating system where users can rate the hidden gems they have discovered significantly
enhances the decision-making process. Initially, our app lacked mechanisms for users to evaluate and
share their opinions on hidden gems. During the paper prototyping phase, we discovered that participants
need a reliable way to gauge the quality of hidden gems. One participant from our usability test stated,
"Being able to see ratings and reviews from other users could really help decide on which places would be
worth visiting."

We integrated a straight forward rating interface in the digital mockup. Users could easily rate gems
on a scale, allowing filtering options that allowed users to sort and read through positive or negative
reviews. This iteration was crucial in providing users with valuable community feedback and empowered
them to make informed choices.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Enhancing Navigation for Better User Control

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: beforeImg,
            alt: "Image of paper prototype before back button navigation and submit buttons were added",
            caption: "Image shows paper prototype before back button and submit buttons were implemented.",
        },
        {
            src: addGem,
            alt: "Image showing application with back buttons and submit buttons",
            caption: "Digital mockup shows functioning back navigation buttons as well as submit buttons.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>


A lack of clear navigation options, such as back buttons and submit buttons, significantly impacted
user experience. During our tests, we observed that users struggled with navigating the app due to
the absence of essential buttons. Specific evidence from these evaluations highlighted that users
often felt lost when they could not return to the main map page after filtering preferences or 
finalizing their contributions without a submit button. One participant noted, "I felt lost on how to
submit my contribution to the Ravenna Chest, theres no way for me to exit either."

Based on the feedback from our first usability testing, we introduced back buttons on each screen
necessary to facilitate easier navigation and a submit button on relevant screens. These adjustments
significantly improved usability and user satisfaction, enabling smoother interactions and better user
control, ultimately enhancing the overall experience as well.



</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Clear Feedback Response

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: beforeNotifs,
            alt: "Paper prototype previously had too many notifications for upgrade and reputation points, it also only appeared in the phone's notification system.",
            caption: "The paper prototype had too many notifications for upgrades and reputation points earned. " +
                "It also unnecessarily delivered through the phone's notification system instead of within the app."
        },
        {
            src: upgradeTier,
            alt: "Mock up image provides notifications integrated as pop-ups within the app to notify users of tier upgrades and earned reputation points.",
            caption: "The mockup has integrated notifications as pop-ups within the app to notify users " +
            "of their tier upgrades and earned reputation points." 
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Unnecessary notifications in the phone's notification center hindered user experience, prompting
the need for a more smooth transition. During our usability tests, it became evident how inconvenient
it is to receive notifications through the phone's notification center rather than as a pop-ups within
the app itself. We also noticed it does not provide a smooth transition and causes disrupts in the users
interaction with the app.

To address this, we reworked the notification system by introducing pop-ups directly within the app. These
in-app pop-ups inform users of tier upgrades and earned reputation points without needing to exit the app.
This iteration provided a more seamless and integrated user experience, reducing interruptions and 
allowing users to stay engaged with the app's current content. By refining the notification system,
we created a more cohesive interaction flow within the app.
