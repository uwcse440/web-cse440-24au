## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

    Discovering unique and memorable experiences shouldnâ€™t be a challenge, yet many existing platforms fail to meet the
    mark. Most travel and location-based apps provide generic recommendations, overcrowded tourist spots, or outdated
    information that lacks personal relevance. Users are often left sifting through reviews, blog posts, and forums,
    hoping to stumble upon hidden gems that truly resonate with their interests. This process is time-consuming and
    frustrating, especially for those looking to explore lowkey, off-the-beaten-path destinations that offer authentic
    and unforgettable experiences.

    Gem Hunter is a community-driven app designed to help users explore and uncover hidden gems near them or wherever
    their adventures take them. Unlike other platforms, Gem Hunter combines the power of user contributions, personalized
    discovery, and gamification to create a vibrant ecosystem for exploring the world. With each new hidden gem
    unlocked, participants will accumulate reputation points which they can use to discover even rarer hidden gems.

## Design Walkthrough

In our mobile application Gem Hunter, we focus on enhancing user engagement and interaction through two key
features. First, we refine the location tracking functionality to ensure precise and reliable discovery of 
hidden gems, allowing participants to unlock new attractions added by others. Second, we developed a 
reputation points system that rewards users for their contributions and discoveries, motivating them
to explore further and engage more deeply with the app. These features are vital as they directly support the
primary goal of our app, which is to foster exploration and build a vibrant community around discovering hidden gems.

### Discovering Hidden Gems On The Go
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },
        {
            src: imagePlaceholder300x600,
            alt: "Every image requires alt text. This should describe the content of that image.",
        },

    direction={"row"}

    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

    Participants can use the Gem Hunter app to uncover new attractions added by others.
    The app's location tracking feature ensures accurate and reliable discovery of these hidden gems.
    When users enter a designated area, they receive notifications about nearby gems. By contributing
    with these gems, they can unlock details and accumulate reputation points.

### Sharing Personal Experiences of Hidden Gems to Obtain Rewards

Participants are encouraged to share their unique experiences and insights about the hidden
gems they discover. The app's intuitive interface makes it simple for users to pin new locations,
upload photos, write reviews, and provide tips for future explorers. As users contribute
valuable content, they earn reputation points that can be redeemed to unlock access to even rarer
hidden gems, enhancing their exploration journey.

## Design Research and Key Insights

To gain a deeper understanding of how users interact with mobile applications that encourage exploration
and community engagement, we conducted a series of tests with our app Gem Hunter. Our primary goal
was to identify how to encourage users to share their discoveries despite their tendency to
gatekeep them,  **[2 MORE INSIGHTS TO LIST]**. To achieve this, we recruited a diverse group of participants,
including individuals with varying levels of technological experience. **[SHOULD ADD MORE TO THIS??]**


### Overcoming Gatekeeping

**[I can't think of another term other than gatekeeping LOL HELPP!!! :')]**

Users often feel a strong sense of ownership over the hidden gems they discover, which can lead to
gatekeeping behavior. During our design research, this insight emerged clearly through our surveys.
Participants expressed a desire to keep unique locations to themselves, fearing that sharing might lead
these spots becoming over populated. One participant noted, "Finding places that are lowkey makes me feel like
that spot was made for me and that I should not share it."

This insight posed a significant challenge of how do we encourage users to share their hidden gems. Reflecting
on this, we identified the need to create compelling incentives for users to share their discoveries.
This led us to gamify our app, introducing a points system where users earn points for finding and sharing
hidden gems. These points can be used to unlock even rarer hidden gems, providing a motivation to share their gems
while still feeling rewarded for their exclusivity.
