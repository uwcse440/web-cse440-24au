{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.

    Discovering unique and memorable experiences should not be a challenge, yet many existing platforms fail to meet the
    mark. Most travel and location-based apps provide generic recommendations, overcrowded tourist spots, or outdated
    information that lacks personal relevance. Users are often left sifting through reviews, blog posts, and forums,
    hoping to stumble upon hidden gems that truly resonate with their interests. This process is time-consuming and
    frustrating, especially for those looking to explore lowkey, off-the-beaten-path destinations that offer authentic
    and unforgettable experiences.

    Gem Hunter is a community-driven app designed to help users explore and uncover hidden gems near them or wherever
    their adventures take them. Unlike other platforms, Gem Hunter combines the power of user contributions, personalized
    discovery, and gamification to create a vibrant ecosystem for exploring the world. With each new hidden gem
    unlocked, participants will accumulate reputation points which they can use to discover even rarer hidden gems.

## Design Walkthrough

In our mobile application Gem Hunter, we focus on enhancing user engagement and interaction through two key
features. First, we refine the location tracking functionality to ensure precise and reliable discovery of 
hidden gems, allowing participants to unlock new attractions added by others. Second, we developed a 
reputation points system that rewards users for their contributions and discoveries, motivating them
to explore further and engage more deeply with the app. These features are vital as they directly support the
primary goal of our app, which is to foster exploration and build a vibrant community around discovering hidden gems.

### Discovering Hidden Gems On The Go
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: radius,
            alt: "Adjust the radius to where you would like to get notified for the hidden gem.",
        },
        {
            src: preferenceImg,
            alt: "Select your preferences of what hidden gems you would like to find.",
        },
        {
            src: pushNotif,
            alt: "After closing your phone, you will get a push notification if you're nearby a hidden gem in your interest.",
        },

        { 
            src: popupImg,
            alt: "Once clicked on the notification, the hidden gem will appear as a in app pop-up with minimal information about the hidden gem found.",
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Set preferred radius and preferences participant wishes to be notified about. " +
        "Once the app is closed, it will send a push notification when a gem matching their preference is nearby. " + 
        "Clicking on the push notification will open the map with a pop-up displaying the selected gem's minimal details."
    }
  
    width={12}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

    Participants are prompted to adjust their radius for nearby gems through an intuitive slider interface,
    ensuring they receive alerts within their preferred range. They can easily set filters for the types of
    gems they wish to discover. As users continue exploring within the radius, they receive a push notification
    about gems that are nearby that meet their criteria from previously. Upon tapping the push notification,
    they are directed to an interactive map where the pop-up of the hidden gem is displayed. They can expand the
    pop-up to view more information on the hidden gem, and from there can decide if they would like to visit the hidden gem.

</ProjectImagesBlock>



### Sharing Personal Experiences of Hidden Gems to Obtain Rewards

Participants are encouraged to share their unique experiences and insights about the hidden
gems they discover. The app's intuitive interface makes it simple for users to pin new locations,
upload photos, write reviews, and provide tips for future explorers. As users contribute
valuable content, they earn reputation points that can be redeemed to unlock access to even rarer
hidden gems, enhancing their exploration journey.

## Design Research and Key Insights


During our design research we gained three key insights: how do we encourage users to share their hidden gems
despite their tendency to withhold them, **[2 more key insights]**. To achieve this, we conducted
surveys and 1-on-1 interviews with a diverse group of participants. For our survey, we distributed a Google Form
that contained 14 questions to gather qualitative and quantitative data. For our 1-on-1 interviews, we conducted
two in-depth sessions with participants from diverse backgrounds, each lasting around 45 minutes.
This approach allowed us to gather valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, guiding the interative
design of our app.


### Encouraging Users to Share Hidden Gems

**[I can't think of another term other than gatekeeping LOL HELPP!!! :')]**

Users often feel a strong sense of ownership over the hidden gems they discover, which can lead to
gatekeeping behavior. During our design research, this insight emerged clearly through our surveys.
Participants expressed a desire to keep unique locations to themselves, fearing that sharing might lead
these spots becoming over populated. **[Add quote from participant]**

This insight posed a significant challenge of how do we encourage users to share their hidden gems. Reflecting
on this, we identified the need to create compelling incentives for users to share their discoveries.
This led us to gamify our app, introducing a rewards point system where users earn points for finding and sharing
hidden gems. These points can be used to unlock even rarer hidden gems, providing a motivation to share their gems
while still feeling rewarded for their exclusivity. "When I find a great low-key spot, I tend to
not want to share it with anyone except close friends/family."

## Iterative Design and Key Insights

To gain a deeper understanding of how users interact with mobile applications that encourage exploration
and community engagement, we conducted a series of tests with our app Gem Hunter, these tests
consisted of paper prototyping, heuristic evaluation, and usability testing. Our primary goal
was to identify how to enhance the decision-making process through a rating system, 
how to improve navigation for better user control and freedom, and **[1 MORE INSIGHT TO LIST]**. 
To achieve this, we recruited a diverse group of participants, including individuals with varying 
levels of technological experience. **[need to add more to this]**


### Implementation of Rating System for Informed Decision Making

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: beforeRatings,
        alt: "A before and after image of implementing the rating system into our application.",
    }}
    caption={
        "Before, the paper prototype shows no ratings or filter ratings within the add a contribution and expand gem page. " +
        "The digital mockup now shows a rating system and filtering to allow users to filter through ratings within the app."
    }
    width={7}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Introducing a rating system where users can rate the hidden gems they have discovered significantly
enhances the decision-making process. Initially, our app lacked mechanisms for users to evaluate and
share their opinions on hidden gems. During the paper prototyping phase, we discovered that participants
need a reliable way to gauge the quality of hidden gems. One participant from our usability test stated,
"Being able to see ratings and reviews from other users could really help decide on which places would be
worth visiting."

We integrated a straight forward rating interface in the digital mockup. Users could easily rate gems
on a scale, allowing filtering options that allowed users to sort and read through positive or negative
reviews. This iteration was crucial in providing users with valuable community feedback and empowered
them to make informed choices.

### Enhancing Navigation for Better User Control

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: beforeImg,
            alt: "Image of paper prototype before back button navigation and submit buttons were added",
            caption: "Image shows paper prototype before back button and submit buttons were implemented.",
        },
        {
            src: addGem,
            alt: "Image showing application with back buttons and submit buttons",
            caption: "Digital mockup shows functioning back navigation buttons as well as submit buttons.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>


A lack of clear navigation options, such as back buttons and submit buttons, significantly impacted
user experience. During our tests, we observed that users struggled with navigating the app due to
the absence of essential buttons. Specific evidence from these evaluations highlighted that users
often felt lost when they could not return to the main map page after filtering preferences or 
finalizing their contributions without a submit button. One participant noted, "I felt lost on how to
submit my contribution to the Ravenna Chest, theres no way for me to exit either."

Based on the feedback from our first usability testing, we introduced back buttons on each screen
necessary to facilitate easier navigation and a submit button on relevant screens. These adjustments
significantly improved usability and user satisfaction, enabling smoother interactions and better user
control, ultimately enhancing the overall experience as well.

### Clearer Feedback Response

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: beforeNotifs,
            alt: "Paper prototype previously had too many notifications for upgrade and reputation points, it also only appeared in the phone's notification system.",
            caption: "The paper prototype had too many notifications for upgrades and reputation points earned. " +
                "It also unnecessarily delivered through the phone's notification system instead of within the app."
        },
        {
            src: upgradeTier,
            alt: "Mock up image provides notifications integrated as pop-ups within the app to notify users of tier upgrades and earned reputation points.",
            caption: "The mockup has integrated notifications as pop-ups within the app to notify users " +
            "of their tier upgrades and earned reputation points." 
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Unnecessary notifications in the phone's notification center hindered user experience, prompting
the need for a more smooth transition. During our usabilty tests, it became evident how inconvenient
it is to receive notifications through the phone's notification center rather than as a pop-ups within
the app itself. We also noticed it does not provide a smooth transition and causes disrupts in the users
interaction with the app.

To address this, we reworked the notification system by introducing pop-ups directly within the app. These
in-app pop-ups inform users of tier upgrades and earned reputation points without needing to exit the app.
This iteration provided a more seamless and integrated user experience, reducing interruptions and 
allowing users to stay engaged with the app's current content. By refining the notification system,
we created a more cohesive interaction flow within the app.
